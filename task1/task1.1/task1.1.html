    <h1>Different Font Formats</h1>
    	<h2>TrueType Fonts (TTF)</h2>
    		<p>TrueType is a font standard developed in the late 1980s, by Apple and Microsoft. TrueType is the most common font format for both the Mac OS and Microsoft Windows operating systems.</p>
		<h2>OpenType Fonts (OTF)</h2>
    		<p>OpenType is a format for scalable computer fonts. It was built on TrueType, and is a registered trademark of Microsoft. OpenType fonts are used commonly today on the major computer platforms.</p>
    	<h2>The Web Open Font Format (WOFF)</h2>
    		<p>WOFF is a font format for use in web pages. It was developed in 2009, and is now a W3C Recommendation. WOFF is essentially OpenType or TrueType with compression and additional metadata. The goal is to support font distribution from a server to a client over a network with bandwidth constraints.</p>
